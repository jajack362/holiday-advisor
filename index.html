        <h3>Zermatt, Switzerland</h3>
        <p>Switzerland's best-known resort brings together every Alpine cliché, from its views of the world's most photogenic mountain, the Matterhorn, to its narrow streets lined with wonky, weathered chalets. Surrounded by 38 summits above 4,000m, the car-free town is full of life all year round. Its population of 5,700 is supplemented by a steady stream of visitors from all over the world who come, winter and summer, to climb, hike, bike and ski the surrounding mountains or simply to admire the scenery. Zermatt has 200km of pistes of its own, and is also linked by lift and piste to Cervinia in Italy, providing another 160km of pistes.

        <h3>Whistler, Canada</h3>
        <p>Boasting dramatic mountain scenery and a lively après scene, Whistler, on the west coast of Canada in British Columbia, is much more European in flavour than most North American resorts. Twenty years ago, it was more of a locals’ mountain than the top international resort it is now. These days, even though it has grown, it still has many of the things that made it so special at the beginning – sniffle stations, Belgian waffles on the mountain, pitchers of margaritas in resort and the sort of powder that inspires singing with joy The Peak 2 Peak gondola links the two mountains of Whistler and Blackcomb, and the resort's 8,171-acre ski area is one of the largest in the world. It also has long top-to-bottom slopes, with 1,610m of vertical on Blackcomb and 1,530m on Whistler. Running from mid-November until May, the season here is long and snow-sure, with an average snowfall of around 12m.</p>

        <h3>Orlando, Florida, North America</h3>
        <p>No question, Florida is theme park heaven. Thrill-seekers love the daredevil rides that get more heart-stopping with each debut while traditionalists are keen to ride the old versions again and again. Young children are wide-eyed at meeting life-size versions of their favorite movie and book characters. Even honeymooners will find amusement, taking selfies in front of fairytale castles. Florida theme parks trade in fantasy for all ages. It seems no one is too old, or too young, to wear a hat of Mickey ears, especially if their name is embroidered on the front. Theme parks in Florida draw visitors from around the world and keen ears pick up the many languages spoken by the guests roaming the parks. Fun is an international language and Florida's theme parks certainly prove that. Orlando International Airport welcomes flights from more than 50 international destinations. Orlando is theme park central, housing the vast Disney World and Universal Orlando complexes. There are many more amusement parks in Florida, though, stretching to other parts of the city and state so we're sure you'll fine a theme park near you. </p>
